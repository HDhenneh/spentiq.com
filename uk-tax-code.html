            <p>A tax code is used by your employer or pension provider to calculate the amount of tax to deduct from your salary or pension. It typically represents your tax allowances.</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                <li><strong>Numbers</strong>: The number in your tax code (e.g., 1257 in 1257L) represents the tax-free amount you’re allowed annually. Multiply the number by 10 to get your tax-free allowance. (1257 means £12,570 tax-free income.)</li>
                <li><strong>Letter L</strong>: The letter indicates how the allowances are adjusted. L means the basic personal allowance. Different letters, like M or N, represent marriage-related adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Tax Codes</strong>: If you see the letters W1, M1, or X, this indicates that emergency tax is being applied, meaning the tax-free allowances are not cumulative over the year.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Codes</strong>: Codes like BR, D0, or NT mean that tax is deducted at a specific rate or that no tax is deducted.</li>
